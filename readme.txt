--prefix map editor v1.1--

a tool to edit voicebank prefix maps outside of utau.

i mean, you could just use notepad, but this exists if you want something a bit more gui-oriented.

how to use:
- under file, either create a new file ("New") or open an existing one ("Open")
- edit the prefixes and suffixes using the gui
- when you are done, save the file ("Save as...")
